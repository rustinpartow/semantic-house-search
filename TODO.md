- [ ] Deploy and get live URL

### 3. **Test Live Deployment** (10 minutes)

## ðŸš¨ NICE TO HAVE (Do After Launch)

### 4. **Custom Domain** (Optional - 10 minutes)

## ðŸŽ¯ LAUNCH CHECKLIST

### Before Sharing with Users:
- [ ] **Live URL works** - Can search and get results
- [ ] **Mobile friendly** - Works on phone/tablet
- [ ] **Error handling** - Shows friendly messages when things break
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Won't get blocked by Zillow
- [ ] **Fast enough** - Results appear within 30 seconds

### Share With Users:
- [ ] **Send URL to friends** - "Hey, try this house search tool!"
- [ ] **Test with real queries** - Let them break it and fix issues
- [ ] **Gather feedback** - What works? What's confusing?

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

### Quick Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:

1. **Create GitHub repo:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rustinpartow/price_per_sqft/property_search
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Semantic House Search"
   # Create repo on GitHub, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-house-search.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages
   - Connect GitHub repo
   - Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Environment: `FLASK_ENV=production`
   - Deploy!

3. **Test:**
   - Visit your `.pages.dev` URL
   - Search for: "high ceilings, natural light, safe neighborhood"
   - Should get results in 10-30 seconds

---

## ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You're done when:**
- âœ… Live URL works
- âœ… People can search and get results
- âœ… Mobile works
- âœ… No crashes or errors
- âœ… Friends can use it without help

**That's it! Everything else is optional.**

---

## ðŸ†˜ IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails** â†’ Check `requirements.txt` is in root
2. **App won't start** â†’ Check `app.py` is in root
3. **No results** â†’ Normal - Zillow rate limiting
4. **Slow searches** â†’ Normal - takes 10-30 seconds

### Quick Fixes:
- Check Cloudflare build logs
- Verify environment variables
- Test locally first: `python app.py`

---

## ðŸŽ¯ TIMELINE

**Total time to launch: ~45 minutes**
- GitHub setup: 15 min
- Cloudflare deploy: 20 min  
- Testing: 10 min

**You can have this live today! ðŸš€**

*Focus on getting it live first, then iterate based on user feedback. Perfect is the enemy of good!*
